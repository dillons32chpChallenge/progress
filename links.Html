Users shared tracks can suggest ways of visiting places. On average over the last few years (to 2015) around one mountain comment and one shared track have appeared daily so there's usually something to see.</p>

					<h3><a <a  href="https://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojo</a></h3>
					<p>CoderDojo is a worldwide movement of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.
The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that itâ€™s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so.
