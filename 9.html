				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 25 Jul 2015. Dillon and I were in Dublin and free for the evening while others went to see Ed Sheeran so we decided to climb Kippure and knock another CHP off the list. We walked up a rough road that was signposted “Military Road” which later reduced to a path straight to the top. It was dry due to the time of year but I suspect it could be quite wet due to the boggy ground at other times of the year. Good views of Dublin and Wicklow from the top and views of the Great Sugarloaf on the way up. This route was just short of 10Km up and back rising 300m and we were back to the car in 3 hours but we were not really rushing. Dillon was delighted to be at the trig of another County High Point, 3 down in about 30 days!</p>
