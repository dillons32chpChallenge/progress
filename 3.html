				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 3 Jul 2016. Nice weather to continue our County High Point Challenge, heading east this time to climb Mt. Leinster, the highest point of Carlow and Wexford. Dillon and I used the recommended route up the Transmitter road starting at an area known as "The 9 stones". Even from the start the views were unbelievable on a very sunny day. We climbed almost 350m and taking our time stopping regularly to take in the views we were back to the car shortly after 1.5 Hrs. Off to Brandon hill next.</p>
				<p>We returned to climb Mt. Leinster for an easy 17 points for  <a href="http://www.highpointireland.com/gribboneer-of-the-year.html">gribboneer-of-the-year</a>  on the 27 Dec 2016. This time a lovely frosty morning gave way to a beautiful red sky as the sun came up. Starting before 8am we were at the trig point, photo taken and back to the car in just over an hour.
