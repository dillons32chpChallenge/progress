				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 06 Jun 2016. The previous day Dillon my sister Helen and I had climbed Truskmore, Truskmore SE Cairn and Seltannasaggart SE Slope. After a rest overnight in Drumshanbo we now had our sights set on Cuilcagh to tick Fermanagh and Cavan off the list of CHP’s. We headed to the Fermanagh side of the mountain near the “Marble Arch Caves” to use the beautiful Cuilcagh Legnabrocky Trail. It really is as impressive as it looks in the pictures and we were again blessed with the weather all the way to the summit and most of the way down. The views and scenery on this walk are outstanding and the boulders as you walk to the summit after the main climb are unusual and amazing too. On two occasions we had to shelter from some violent Thunder and Lightning storms before we returned to the car but luckily we were not stuck near the summit when this happened. Dillon was glad to be back to the car from this one. Up and back we covered 14 km, a height gain of 470m taking us almost 5 hours including our stops from the weather.</p>
