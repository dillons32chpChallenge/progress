				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 05 Jun 2016. Continuing from our walk to Truskmore it was an easy and quick stroll for Dillon, My sister Helen and I to go over to Truskmore SE Cairn to say we were at the highest point of Leitrim. We returned by making our way back to the transmitter road and followed it back down to the car.</p>
