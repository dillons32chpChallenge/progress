				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 05 Jun 2016. After completing Truskmore and Truskmore SE Cairn Dillon my sister Helen and I followed the Sat Nav to the start point of Roscommon's CHP, Seltannasaggart SE Slope as indicated in <a href="http://www.kierongribbon.com/">Kieron Gribbonâ€™s</a>  book "Ireland's County High Points - A Walking Guide". We joined the Miners Way for part of the route to the summit. A small heap of stones marks the highest point and it is surrounded by approx 50 Wind Turbines. It was a relatively easy walk after Truskmore a rise of just 118m. </p>
