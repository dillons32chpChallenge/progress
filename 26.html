				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 05 Jun 2016. Dillon, my sister Helen and I set out early on the morning of 05 Jun with the goal of completing 3 CHP's and continuing on the 06th Jun with another 5. Our first was Truskmore and arriving at the start point travelling from Cork meant we needed to have some food before setting off on the transmitter road around noon. It was a very hot day and while the route is very straightforward it is quite steep, a total of 463m. Around half way up a cyclist passed us, challenging his muscles to the extreme, he was just leaving the top when we arrived at the summit. That was Sligo's CHP done. We got the necessary picture at the trig before heading over to Truskmore SE Cairn.</p>
