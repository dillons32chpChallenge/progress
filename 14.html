				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 3 Jul 2016. After climbing Mt. Leinster earlier in the day Dillon and I headed off to reach the summit of Brandon Hill at 5pm from the top of the farm road close to Graiguenamanagh. The walk was straightforward with great views from the top with an information plate showing everything to be seen in the distance. With such a clear day we could see the river Barrow below and in the distance Slievenamon and the Commeraghs. After walking 5 Km we were back to the car with a height of 283m climbed in just over an hour and a half.</p>
