				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 20 Jun 2016. While on holidays in Donegal we watched for an opportunity to climb Errigal. The weather was generally good but Errigal often has a cloud at the top. Rachel, Dillon and I started the walk to the summit of Errigal after 4 PM on a lovely summer's afternoon. We did a bit of ziz/zag again to avoid the worst of the boggy parts at the start and soon enough we were on a much drier and stony surface as we started to climb. We had great visibility and there was no problem with working out where to go all the way to the top. Errigal offers fantastic views in all directions, Lough Altan on one side and views over Dunlewy lough and beyond on the other. After a few photos we headed back down to the car park on the R251 where we started. This route took us about 2.5 Hrs climbing a height of 475m and a distance of 4.5 Km up and back.</p>
