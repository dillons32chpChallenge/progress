				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 06 Jun 2016. As we arrived at Carnbane East (Slieve Na Calliagh) the CHP of county Meath, Mother Nature was roaring again, there were a few claps of thunder and flashes of lightening. We had read that it was a short trek across a field to the summit which was also the home of Loughcrew Megalithic Cairns. In minutes we were at the top and at that stage the thunder and Lightning was very frequent and quite harsh, Dillon allowed me take one picture and I pushed for two before we literally flew off that hillside back to the car. We will have to return at our leisure to see the Cairns in more detail another time (we were there less than 15 minutes for this visit) but for now our two day mission was complete, 8 CHP's done, thanks to my sister Helen for walking with us and well done to Dillon, a great achievement, a total of 14 county covered so far in the challenge. The long drive to County Cork via the outskirts of Dublin remained and the lightening lit up the road frequently for the journey.</p>
