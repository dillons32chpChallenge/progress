				<p>The challenge is to climb to the highest point in all 32 counties of Ireland. Because some counties share the same highest point this means climbing to 27 points as detailed below. 
Discovering the challenge was accidental while searching the internet for mountains to Climb in West Cork while on holidays in the area. At that time I had already climbed Galtymore which meant after climbing Knockboy in Cork, only Waterford, Kerry and Clare remained to complete the counties of Munster. This became a goal for 2015 and was completed by September that year. That summer Lugnagulla (Wicklow) and Kippure (Dublin) were also completed, starting off Leinster too.
The challenge resumed in 2016 by completing Arderin, the highest point of Laois and Offaly, bringing the count to 10 out of 32 counties completed.
In May 2016 it was decided to use the challenge to try and raise funds for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kildorrery.karate?fref=ts">kildorrery karate</a> and <a href="http://www.cdys.ie/">Cloyne Diocesan Youth Services</a> (CYDS). I aim to complete the challenge before I turn 11 years old.
