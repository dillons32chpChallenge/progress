				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 06 Jun 2016. Our second last of 8 CHP's in two days, Dillon my sister Helen and I arrived at Mullaghmeen forest Park at 7:30pm to climb to Westmeath's highest point Mullaghmeen. The route we took was a lovely forest walk to the summit and we had views of lough Sheelin from the top. We were back to the car after an hour so this would be one of the easier CHP's and a nice walk too. The day wasn't over yet though as we had planned to complete Meath also.</p>
