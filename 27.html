				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 28 Jul 2016. I had climbed Galtymore many times mostly using the Black Road route and even at age 6 Dillon climbed to the top with me. However for our County High point Challenge we needed a proper picture at both the Tipperary CHP and Limerick CHP. So on 28 July we set off from Clydagh Bridge on the Anglesboro side at around 2 Pm to walk a loop taking in both Galtymore and Galtybeg and back to the car. We had intended to include Cush but the weather put a stop to that. The views were clear and good at the start but mist moved in before we reached the top. We got the proper picture of Limerick's CHP (A cairn) and Tipperary's CHP (the trig) before heading over to Galtybeg and descending back to the car. Dillon had now visited 29 county high points!</p>
				<p>With great spirit and determination Dillon walked with me to the top of Galtymore three more times in December, each time by the black road and each time reaching the summit before 9am. The extra climbs were worth 19 points each time for  <a href="http://www.highpointireland.com/gribboneer-of-the-year.html">gribboneer-of-the-year</a> The weather was outstanding for the walks even though it was December and so early in the morning. One of the mornings was frosty with a full moon allowing us to walk without a light and giving way to a beautiful red sunrise just as we reached the top.
