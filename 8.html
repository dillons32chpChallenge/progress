					<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 24 Jul 2016. We were in Dublin for a few days, so Dillon and I headed north and tackled Slieve Donard, County Down's highest Point, also the highest point in Ulster. The day was fine with a few showers but the top was cloudy. However we got some good pictures on our way up. A lovely walk and unbelievable to see and walk beside the Mourne wall built around 1910 and still standing. We went From Donard Park through Donard Wood up the Glen River track turning left at the Mourne Wall and following the steep climb to the top. The walk saw us climb almost 820m with a return distance of 10 Km in just less than 4 hours.</p>
