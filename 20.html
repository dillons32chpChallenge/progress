				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 05 Aug 2016. Being in Belfast for other business Dillon and I took a detour on the way home and parked in Carlingford just before six on a beautiful summers afternoon. Carlingford is a lovely coastal town and the famous Carlingford Oyster Festival was on at the time so the town was buzzing. We walked through the tiny streets and left all the noise behind following the straightforward route to the top of Slieve Foye. We noticed we were climbing right from the start as we set off from sea level. Views on the climb were fantastic as were the views back towards Carlingford. We recorded a climb of 564m to the top returning to the car after 2.5 hrs covering almost 8Km. A road race was just finishing in the town as we returned; it felt like we were passing the finishing line too!</p>
