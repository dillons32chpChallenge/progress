				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 26 Jun 2015. It was during a search for mountains to climb while on a break in the Schull area that I learned that Knockboy was the highest point in Cork. My daughter Rachel and son Dillon joined me for the walk. We started near the famous “Priests Leap” and although it was misty with poor visibility we managed to follow the fence, following the twists and turns to the Trig at the top. We had no visibility at the top but there were some views on the way down again. We went slightly astray on the way down at one of the fence crossings but spotted it in time thank God. In total we walked 9Km rising over 350m in about 3 hours. The road up to the Priests Leap is very unique to say the least and well worth the visit but it definitely is not for the faint hearted.<H4>UP CORK!!!<H4></p>
