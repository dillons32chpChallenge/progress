				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>13) Kildare

Walk Date: 25 Jun 2016. A spur of the moment decision even though it was late in the evening and we still had quite a long way to go to Kildorrery on our journey home from holidays in Donegal saw us going back and forth near the M7 around Naas to find the start point of Kildare's highest point. This was more to do with our Sat Nav acting up than anything. We finally found the forestry entrance as described in <a href="http://www.kierongribbon.com/">Kieron Gribbon's</a> book "Ireland's County High Points - A Walking Guide". Cupidstown Hill is probably one of the fastest of the 32 county high points to complete. It took Rachel, Dillon and I just over 10 minutes to be back to the car and on the road again for home.
