				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 22 Jun 2016. Even though we were over on the West coast of Donegal on holidays we had our eye on two neighbouring county to the east, Derry and Tyrone, and in particular "Sawel Mountain", a shared county high point of both these county. Rachel joined Dillon and me and we drove the width of the county of Donegal into county Derry to climb it. We parked on the Sperrin road as detailed by <a href="http://www.kierongribbon.com/">Kieron Gribbon's</a> book "Ireland's County High Points - A Walking Guide" and followed the fence to the summit. The fence pretty much followed the border of Derry and Tyrone to the trig stone and the route was boggy and wet in parts. Fantastic views again from the top of this one. It took just short of 2 hours up and back, a distance of 5Km, climbing over 330m.</p>
