				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 06 Sep 2015. Our last CHP of the year was Moylussa in Clare and again it was Rachel, Dillon and I on the walk. Blessed again with good weather the views of Lough Derg as we climbed above it were magnificent. The route we took was mostly a forest road except a bit of open mountain at the end. The top near the summit is very boggy and this was in early September so I expect it would be worse in the winter. We climbed over 460m to the top over a distance of 10 Km in about 3 hours. This wrapped up the CHP challenge for 2015.</p>
