				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 06 Jun 2016. As we drove away from Cuilcagh it was still raining and Dillon, my sister Helen and I were hoping it would stop by the time we travelled to the start of Longford's CHP, Corn Hill. It was a little over an hour away with a stop for a bit of food and sure enough the weather cleared up before we got to the start of the walk. Considering this was our 6th CHP in two days we were delighted to see that it was only a short stroll up to the trig stone next to a mast. It measured a mile up and back and we were in the car again within 20 minutes heading for Westmeath.</p>
