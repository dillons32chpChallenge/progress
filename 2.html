				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 24 Jul 2016. After climbing Slieve Donard earlier in the day Dillon and I arrived at Slieve Gullion Forest Park before 5 Pm but heavy rain put us off starting the walk. By the time we had exited the park by driving the one way forest drive the weather had changed so we decided to go around again and stop at the car park at the beginning of the climb. There are some fantastic views from this climb but at the top we could see another thunder shower was fast approaching so our decent was fast, making it to the car just in time before the heavens opened. We were up and back in less than an hour covering 2.7 Kms and climbing 195m.</p>
