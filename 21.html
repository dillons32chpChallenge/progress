				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 11 Jul 2016. After our failed attempt at Benbaun a day earlier due to harsh weather we awoke to an only slightly better day for our planned climb of Mweelrea. It was still raining and misty as we ate breakfast in The <a href="http://www.oceanlodgekilladoon.com/">Ocean Lodge Hotel</a>  before setting off. We followed the route described in <a href="http://www.kierongribbon.com/">Kieron Gribbons</a> book “Ireland's County High Points – A Walking Guide”. The rain continued for a lot of the climb making the climb extra difficult with huge care required not to lose our way in the clouds. Fair play to Dillon for completing this one, the most difficult so far out of all the County High Points completed due to the weather. On reaching the summit, we took a quick picture and were glad to head back down. We were lucky with some lovely views on the decent with many full streams and waterfalls after all the rain all around us on the route. Up and back we covered 10Km taking us just short of 4 hours and climbing a height of almost 800m. </p>
