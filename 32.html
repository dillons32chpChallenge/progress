				<p>The following account of walking on this mountain written by Dad appeared as a comment on <a href=" http://mountainviews.ie/">Mountain Views</a></td> where there are several other accounts of this and other mountains available to read also. This can be a great way to research if you are planning any of these climbs. We also found Kieron Gribbon's <a href=" http://www.highpointireland.com/"> High Point Ireland website</a> to be a useful source of information for our 32 County High Points challenge. Definitely worth checking out if you're planning to do any of the High Point challenges.</p>

				<p>Walk Date: 23 Jul 2015. I had walked Lugnaquilla previously in 2011 from near the Glenmalure Hostel returning into the Glenmalure valley via the zig zags and walking the road back up to the car. This time we were staying nearby for a few nights and my daughter Rachel and son Dillon joined me on the climb. We climbed the same route as previously but this time returned the same way due to it getting a bit close to evening. It was a nice evening for the walk with good enough visibility and views. This time we were on the mountains for about 4.5 hrs covering over 14 Km climbing a height of 800m.</p>
